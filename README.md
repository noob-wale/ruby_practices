To create an interactive program you need to have an outout and input.
In ruby to output data on a screen we use the #puts method and #print method.
the main difference between the two methods is that #puts appends a newline to the output while #print maintains one line.

# VARIABLES

variables are a way of assigning data to names in your program.
variable names are reusable.
to declare a variable we use the equal sign =
they allow us to organize our data in our programs.
we can change and moddify variable values too.

# DATA TYPES
string, numbers, boolean,

we can use string methods to modify our string.

# NUMBERS

    b) FLoat (decimal numbers)
